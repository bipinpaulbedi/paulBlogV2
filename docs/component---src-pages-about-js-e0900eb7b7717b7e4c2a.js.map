I'm bipin, a software developer, entrepreneur and\n      open source contributor who's originally from New Delhi, India and\n      currently living in the Sydney, Australia. Over the course of my career\n      I've had the pleasure of working with a wealth of different technologies\n      for various sized companies, mainly operating in very agile teams\n      following Scrum or Kanban, using continuous deployment and most major\n      clouds (AWS, Google and Azure) to deliver mission critical software. I was\n      also lucky enough to lead and manage a team of highly skilled engineers\n      building large scale enterprise systems. After almost 10 years in the\n      corporate world, numerous battle scars and a growing appetite for a new\n      adventure I finally threw the towel in 2019, decided to take more risks in\n      life. Today I maintain several open source projects, contract on a side\n      whilst also trying to set up my own start-up from the ground up. If I'm\n      not busy building something technical then I'm probably doing sports\n      (basketball, skating, swimming), reading a book or travelling. I also\n      experiment a lot in cooking and tasting different cuisines and coffee ,\n      which means that I spend a fair amount of my time exploring new coffee\n      shops and restaurants in Sydney and around the world. However, besides all\n      of these hobbies my absolute favourite downtime activity is a round of\n      board games with friends and family, though not many people know about\n      this.\n    </AboutContent>{\" \"}\n    <h1> Paul Blog</h1>\n    <AboutContent>\n      Paul blog is a blog which I've started in 2008 and restarted in 2009,\n      20011, 2013, 2015 and 2019 [hoping to be last restart] after finally\n      convincing myself to put some of my thoughts and ideas into writing. On\n      this blog I mostly write about technical topic with a strong focus on .NET\n      Core, F# and C#, Go, elixir, python, machine learning, security and\n      cryptography, general programming trends, agile methodologies and software\n      security practises.{\" \"}\n    </AboutContent>\n    <h1>Support</h1>\n    <AboutContent>\n      If you've got value from any of the content which I have created or you'd\n      like to support the development and maintenance of any of my projects then\n      I would very much appreciate your support by buying me a coffee.\n    </AboutContent>\n    <h1>Hire Me</h1>\n    <AboutContent>\n      Since 2019 I have been working as an independent software engineer.
